## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use ::after for attaching an icon to a text element
- How to use JavaScript for toggling the question
- How to center and place images in the right spots
- How to use gradients
- How to use divs to display images from css
- How to use media queries effectively to go from mobile view to destkop
- How to use grid and grid-areas


### Continued development

- Placing of stylish background images is a major problem and I think I should do more projects with images to get comfortable with complex visual elements.
